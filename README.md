# Sudoku_Solver
A sudoku solver written in python that I'm still working on. Although it does work the UI isn't appealing and both the keybinds and input are unintuitive. It uses OOP, pygame and defined functions to achieve its end goal.
Use left mouse click to change a number, middle mouse click to solve the entire board or right mouse click to solve the selected square.
Numbers range from 1 - 9, with 0 being unknown.
