# Sudoku_Solver
A sudoku solver written in python that I'm still working on. Although it does work the UI isn't appealing and both the keybinds and input are unintuitive. It uses OOP, pygame, defined functions and a backtracking algorithm to achieve its end goal.
Use left mouse click to change a number. Numbers range from 1 - 9, with 0 being unknown.
